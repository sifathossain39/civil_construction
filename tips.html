                    <h6>Things to keep in mind before building a house</h6>
                    <p>People are social animals because they live in a society. And if you want to live in the society,
                        you need a house. When a number of houses and houses are combined, a society is formed with the
                        neighborhood. So people have to build houses.</p>
                    <p>But before building a house, one has to keep some things in mind as a human being. One of them is
                        that the house should not have a negative impact on the society or the environment.</p>
                    <p>Besides, before building a house, one has to think most about its infrastructural aspects. No one
                        will go home for two days in a row. If a natural disaster like an earthquake or a fire destroys
                        a hobby house and it causes loss of life, then both the investment and the threat to life
                        remain.
                        Therefore, the house should be strong, durable, environmentally friendly. And there are several
                        things you should consider when building a home to ensure these things. So discussed below-</p>
                    <ul class="mb-3">
                        <li>Just as an architect is needed to build a beautiful house, a civil engineer or a
                            structural engineer is needed to build a strong structure. Who will give a balanced
                            design of the foundation, rod, cement of your house. Which will protect the house from
                            earthquakes, storms. These are your home doctors. Do not neglect at all. Forgetting a
                            little today may cost a lot in the future. Your investment and life will be at risk. So
                            hire a structural engineer or consulting firm before building a house.</li>
                        <li>Have you done soil test before building the house? Among many, this work is severely
                            neglected and tends to save money. Please never do that. Soil testing is very important.
                            Be sure to talk to your civil engineer or structural engineer before testing the soil.
                            Because he will tell you how deep you have to bore with the height of your building.
                        </li>
                        <li>When building a house, keep a supervision engineer so that the quality of work is good
                            and the work is completed according to the drawing. While the task may seem trivial, it
                            is urgent. Let's give an example. You were not present during the casting of a column or
                            beam for any reason while doing your homework. Or a mistake due to too little water in
                            the concrete mixer is a very small matter to you. Subject. But did you know that even if
                            the beam or column is not well cast, it will stand on its own weight in the building?
                            There are also many buildings standing. But he doesn't have the strength to take big
                            shocks. The earthquake will catch the first fracture in that part. It can be calculated.
                        </li>
                        <li>Take skilled mechanics who have previous work experience.</li>
                        <li>‘Safety Fast’. That is not unreasonable at all. Know the staff and neighbors, it is your
                            responsibility to keep the goods safe until your installation is completed.</li>
                        <li>Bought a rod? Don't just look at expensive companies or buy cheap rods to save money.
                            Rather look at the quality. Make sure that the shop you are buying rods of the grade
                            (40,60,75) has all the rods of the same grade and the same company. Find out which grade
                            of rod is mentioned in your design.</li>
                        <li>Another important material is cement. The quality of cement is relatively good in our
                            country. However, you can check the test report before buying. Consult your structural
                            engineer if necessary. After buying it, keep it in a dry place so that it does not get
                            watery. If you open the cement before work and see that the cement is frozen, change it.
                            Don't take any risks. Casting is not a national task at all.</li>
                        <li>Look at the grain of sand and buy it. So that the FM of sand (FM = Fineness Modulus) is
                            correct. Sift through a sieve before work so that there is no dirt.</li>
                        <li>Khoya (stone, brick) Whatever you give, be sure to buy clean and good quality khoya.
                            Soak with water before use.</li>
                        <li>Curing after welding is done. Especially columns, beams, roofs. If necessary, wrap the
                            sack so that the water can hold for a long time. This will hold the cement well. With
                            less water, cracks will appear like light hair and the concrete will not get its proper
                            strength.</li>
                        <li>Don't panic about earthquakes, do that before building a house. Save the small building
                            and save the people in the big building. Hope you understand. Adhere to the right design
                            and the right amount of rod, sand, concrete you use is risk free. But yes, none of you
                            have the power to do anything on nature.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, keep a close eye on whether the columns, beams, grade beams have fixed the rods, the
                        ring rods, straight rods, lapping rods. It is often seen that the columns are absolutely cast,
                        never do it. If the column in your building is weak but nothing can stop it from collapsing.
                        Consult your structural engineer if necessary.</p>
                    <p>A design is simply a plan. Before constructing a building, a design needs to be drawn by an
                        architect or engineer. Sometimes an architect or engineer makes a model of the building with
                        cardboard or plastic. The building is then constructed by a construction company that follows
                        the planning guidelines for the building.</p>
